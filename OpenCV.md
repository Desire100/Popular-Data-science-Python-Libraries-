# OpenCV 
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) is a libray of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computr vision.It contains alogorithms for computer vison, including object detection and tracking algorithms built-in.

# Image Basics Goals
#### Be able to open image files with OpenCV in both notebook and  pythion script.
#### Draw simple geometries  on images.
#### Directly interact with an image through callbacks.

# Image Processing Goals
#### Learn various image processing operations
#### Perform image operations such as smoothing, blurring, morphological Operations
#### Grab properties such as color spaces and histograms.

Thresholding is fundamentally a very simple method of segmenting an image into different parts.
Thresholding will convert an image to consist of only two values, white or black.
