# OpenCV 
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) is a libray of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computr vision.It contains alogorithms for computer vison, including object detection and tracking algorithms built-in.

# Image Basics Goals
#### Be able to open image files with OpenCV in both notebook and  pythion script.
#### Draw simple geometries  on images.
#### Directly interact with an image through callbacks.

# Image Processing Goals
#### Learn various image processing operations
#### Perform image operations such as smoothing, blurring, morphological Operations
#### Grab properties such as color spaces and histograms.

Thresholding is fundamentally a very simple method of segmenting an image into different parts.
Thresholding will convert an image to consist of only two values, white or black.

##### A common operation for image processing is blurring or smoothing an image. smoothing an image can help get rid of noise, or help an application focus on general details. Often blurring or smooothing is combined with edge detection. E

##### Edge detection algorithms detect too many edges when shown a high resolution image without any blurring.

### Gamma Correction
Gamma correction can be applied to an image to make it appear brighter or darker depending on the Gamma value chosen.

### Image Gradient
An image gradient is a directional change in the intensity or color in an image.

### Histogram
A histogram is a visual representation of the distrubution of a continuous feature.
