# Popular-Data-science-Python-Libraries-
This repo covers the most popular python data science libraries projects including Numpy, SciPy, Pandas, SciKit-Learn, Matplotlib, plotly, Seaborn, PySpark for big data and much more.

We will start with NumPy which is the scientific computing library for python which allow us to work with data arrays in Python. We will contunue our understanding by learning Pandas which is a fantastic data analysis library that allows us to re-manipulate data from multiple sources including csv files, excell docs, html web pages for web scraping and much better. 

We will also discuss basic data visualization by using matplotlib library then later on we will create a beautiful statistical plot with the Seaborn library.
